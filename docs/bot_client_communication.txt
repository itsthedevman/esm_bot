Bot communication:
    To communicate with a client, ESM::Server#send_message is preferred.
    This method takes in the following:
        - command: ESM::Command, default: nil
        - data: Hash<String, Any>
        - metadata: Hash<String, Any>

    To communicate with the server, ESM::Connection::Server.send_message is used.
    This method takes in the following:
        - type: String
        - data: Hash<String, Any>
        - metadata: Hash<String, Any>

    Internally, ESM::Connection::Server handles both types of requests using the #__messenger method. This internal method only accepts an instance of ESM::Connection::Request. This method's job is to facilitate tracking, building, and sending the message to the Server.

ESM::Connection::Request needs to generate a message with the following attributes:
    - id: String - The ID for tracking this request
    - type: String - Describes what is in "data" and "metadata". This is used by Serde for deserializating those fields. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61190379/is-there-a-way-to-define-a-tag-field-with-serde
    - server_id: String - The ID of the server this message should go to.
    - data: Hash<String, Any> - The data to send with the message.
    - metadata: Hash<String, Any> - The metadata to send with the message
    - errors: Array<String> - Any errors that occurred. This field is only used when replying back to message from the client

ESM::Connection::Request#initialize will take in the following data:
    - server_id: String
    - data: Hash<String, Any>
    - metadata: Hash<String, Any>
