# This packet class represents a A2M_GET_SERVERS_BATCH2 request sent to a
# master server
#
# It is used to receive a list of game servers matching the specified filters.
#
# Filtering:
# Instead of filtering the results sent by the master server locally, you
# should at least use the following filters to narrow down the results sent by
# the master server. Receiving all servers from the master server is taking
# quite some time.
#
# Available filters:
#
# * `\type\d`: Request only dedicated servers
# * `\secure\1`: Request only secure servers
# * `\gamedir\[mod]`: Request only servers of a specific mod
# * `\map\[mapname]`: Request only servers running a specific map
# * `\linux\1`: Request only linux servers
# * `\emtpy\1`: Request only **non**-empty servers
# * `\full\`: Request only servers **not** full
# * `\proxy\1`: Request only spectator proxy servers

  #
  # @param cause [:http_error, :invalid_key, :status_bad, :unauthorized] A
  #   symbolic name for the problem which caused this error:
  #
  #   * `:http_error`: An error during the HTTP request itself will result
  #   in an error with this reason.
  #   * `:invalid_key`: This occurs when trying to set a Web API key that
  #   isn't valid, i.e. a 128 bit integer in a hexadecimal string.
  #   * `:status_bad`: This is caused by a successful request that fails
  #   for some Web API internal reason (e.g. an invalid argument).
  #   Details about this failed request will be taken from `status_code`
  #   and `status_message`.
  #   * `:unauthorized`: This happens when a Steam Web API request is
  #   rejected as unauthorized. This most likely means that you did not
  #   specify a valid Web API key using {WebApi.api_key=}. A Web API key
  #   can be obtained from http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey.
  #
  #   Other undefined reasons will cause a generic error message.
  # @param status_code [Fixnum] The HTTP status code returned by the Web API
  # @param status_message [String] The status message returned in the response
  # @return [WebApiError] a new instance of WebApiError
