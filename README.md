# What is Exile Server Manager?
Exile Server Manager, or ESM for short, is a Discord Bot that facilitates interacting with an Arma 3 Exile server. Server owners and players alike can link their Steam accounts with ESM to enable running various commands to interact with their characters on any server they have joined.

## Before continuing...
Are you a server owner or player looking to use Exile Server Manager? If so, please visit my <a href="https://www.esmbot.com/wiki">Getting Started</a> section of the Wiki as this README is focused on the development side of ESM.

## Getting Started
ESM is written in MRI Ruby 2.6.5 with DiscordRB 3.3.0 and PostgreSQL 12. I, personally, use <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a> to manage Ruby, but ESM is not dependent on it.
