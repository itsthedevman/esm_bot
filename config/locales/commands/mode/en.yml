      description: Changes me between "player" and "server" modes which affect how I function in your community
      description_extra: |-
        When I am in "player mode", I chill with you and your friends on your Discord server, waiting to execute a command on the servers you play on.
        When I am in "server mode", I become a liaison between your Exile server(s) and its players, allowing them to run my commands on it. You may configure how I respond to commands on your server from the server dashboard.
      examples:
        - description: |-
            If "player mode" is enabled, this will cause me to swap to "server mode"
            If "player mode" is disabled (in "server mode"), I will attempt to switch to "player mode". If you have server still registered with me, you will need to delete them via my [Dashboard](https://www.esmbot.com/server_dashboard) first.

      enabled: "✅ Player mode has been enabled for **%{community_name}**. All of my player commands may now be used on its Discord server"
      disabled: "✅ Player mode has been disabled for **%{community_name}**. You may now manage your community and servers via my [Dashboard](https://www.esmbot.com/server_dashboard)"
      errors:
        servers_exist: I'm sorry %{user}, in order to enable player mode you must remove any servers you've registered via my [Dashboard](https://www.esmbot.com/portal)
