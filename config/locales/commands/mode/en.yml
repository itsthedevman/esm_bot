      description_extra: |-
        When I am in "player" mode, I chill with you and your friends on your Discord server, waiting to execute a command on the servers you play on. 
        When I am in "server" mode, I become a liaison between your Exile server(s) and its players, allowing them to run my commands on it. You may configure how I respond to commands on your server from the server dashboard.
      example: |-
        **`/community admin change_mode esm server`**
        Disables player mode. Set this mode if your community hosts servers

        **`/community admin change_mode esm player`**
        Enables player mode. Set this mode if you play on servers
      enabled: "✅ Player mode has been enabled for **%{community_name}**. All of my player commands may now be used on its Discord server"
      disabled: "✅ Player mode has been disabled for **%{community_name}**. You may now manage your community and servers via my [Dashboard](https://www.esmbot.com/portal)"
