      description: |-
        Requests a reward package to be deployed on the provided server. After running this command, you will be sent a confirmation message in your PMs with me. From here, you'll confirm you are online and alive before I send deliver the rewards to you.

        **IMPORTANT**
        If the provided server is still running v1, this command will ignore `<reward_id>` and use the default reward package.
      example: |-
        **`%{prefix}reward esm_malden`**
        Requests the default reward to be delivered to you on `esm_malden`.

        **`%{prefix}reward esm_altis base_kit`**
        Requests the `base_kit` reward package to be delivered to you on `esm_altis`
      arguments:
        reward_id: TODO
      reward_description: |-
        Hey there, %{user}!

        Before we get to the good stuff, I need you to do the following:

        - Join `%{server_id}` and spawn in. Make sure you're in a safe place!
        - Confirm you have enough space on or around you to spawn in the following items/vehicles
        - Remember, items that don't fit in your inventory **will be dropped on the ground at your feet**

        Reward `%{reward_id}` contains the following:
      check_pm: Hey %{user}. Before I can process your request, I need to confirm
        a few things. Please reply to the message in your Direct Messages to continue.
      no_reply: Hey %{user}, I haven't heard from you in awhile so I cancelled your
        request. Please re-run the previous command when you're ready to continue
      receipt: |-
        Hi %{user}, the following goodies have been delivered to you!
        %{items}
