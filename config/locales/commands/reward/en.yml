      description: |-
        Requests a reward package to be deployed on the provided server. After running this command, you will be sent a confirmation message in your PMs with me. From here, you'll confirm you are online and alive before I send deliver the rewards to you.

        **IMPORTANT**
        If the provided server is still running v1, this command will ignore `<reward_id>` and use the default reward package.
      example: |-
        **`%{prefix}reward esm_malden`**
        Requests the default reward to be delivered to you on `esm_malden`.

        **`%{prefix}reward esm_altis base_kit`**
        Requests the `base_kit` reward package to be delivered to you on `esm_altis`

        reward_id: "The ID of the reward you would like to receive. If omitted, the default reward will be given"
      errors:
        check_pm: "Hey %{user}. Before I can process your request, I need to confirm a few things. Please reply to the message in your Direct Messages to continue."
        no_reply: "Hey %{user}, I haven't heard from you in awhile so I cancelled your request. Please re-run the previous command when you're ready to continue"
        waiting_for_reply: "Hey %{user}, I am already processing a reward request for you. If you would like to start over, just reply back with \"cancel\" and then you may use this command"
        incorrect_reward_id: "I'm sorry %{user}, I was unable to find a reward with the ID of `%{reward_id}`"
        no_reward_items: "I'm sorry %{user}, the selected reward package is not available at this time"
        territory_query: "I'm sorry %{user}, I ran into an issue syncing territory data. Please wait a moment before trying again"
        no_territories: "Before you confirm, you should know that this reward package also contains vehicles for you, but you have no territories. If you would like to receive these vehicles as well, please "

          - Remember, items that don't fit in your inventory **will be dropped on the ground at your feet**
