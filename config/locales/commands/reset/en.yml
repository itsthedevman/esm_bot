      request_description: |-
        Hey %{user}, you have requested to have one or all players reset on `%{server}`. In order for the process to work, the player(s) needs to have been spawned in at least once and they cannot be logged into the server when you confirm this.

        **Warning, this process is destructive.**
        If you confirm, one or all players on `%{server}` will be deleted and any items or poptabs on their players will be lost.
      success_message_target: "%{user}, %{target} has been reset successfully. Please instruct them to join the server again to confirm."
      success_message_all: "%{user}, I've reset all stuck players."
      failure_message_target: "%{user}, %{target} is not stuck. Please have them join the server again, and if they are still stuck, instruct them to close Arma 3 and then attempt this command again."
      failure_message_all: "%{user}, I was unable to find anyone who was stuck."
