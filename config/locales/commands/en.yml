          Hi, Bryan here - I'm the sole developer of Exile Server Manager.

          First, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for using this bot, and thank you for being curious.

          ESM is a passion project of mine. I originally created ESM for my end of semester project during university in Dec 2017. Back then it was just a tiny website written in PHP (_cringe_) and it had very little functionality. It list the server's territories and that was it. After the semester was over, I continued to expand its functionality and soon it outgrew the website and took on a new shell as a Discord bot written in JavaScript with a C# Arma 3 server extension.

          Released for public use on June 6th 2018, ESM launched with a **total of 13 player commands**. The `%{prefix}reward` command wasn't even one of them! Over the next year I continued to release updates to the bot, server extension, and website with more features, more commands, and even more bug fixes. _Oh so many bug fixes..._
          Come March 2019, ESM would reach version `1.0.0` and would gain that glorious reward command.
          _Oh, while I'm here, huge shout out to the Mafia Bosses on ESM's Discord. They supported ESM through thick and thin and I am so grateful for them._

          Not much happened after 1.0.0 became "stable". At this point ESM was functioning, but it was slowly failing. The lack of knowledge and experience when I started this project meant that ESM had some design flaws within its core systems. It was working, but it had reached the point of diminishing returns.

          By Oct 2019, I was working full time as a Ruby developer and had a year or so work experience under my belt. Armed with more knowledge, I set out to re-imagine ESM.

          _And this time, it was made out of Ruby._

          On Jan 2nd 2021, version 2.0.0 was released. I was rewritten in MRI Ruby, but still using my original server extension. This update brought improvements to every one of my commands and features. But most importantly, it laid a foundation for new features in the future.

            name: "**What's next?**"
            value: |-
              I'm still running strong and my author is still working on me. As I mentioned above, I am still using my original Arma 3 server extension. This piece of me is old, outdated, and unfortunately is blocking my author from adding a lot of new and exciting features.
              Good news though, my author is currently working on completely rewriting the Arma 3 server extension from the ground up. New commands, improvements to the reward command (_among others_), speed improvements, possible linux support (_waaaaat?_), and more!
