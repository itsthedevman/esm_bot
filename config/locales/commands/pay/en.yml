      description_extra: |-
        Some servers may implement a tax for paying using ESM. You can see how much your territory's protection cost is by using `/territory list`
      example: |-
        ```
        /territory pay territory:qqoej on:esm_malden
        ```Pay the territory protection for `qqoej` on server `esm_malden`

        ```
        /territory pay territory:fort_kickass on:esm_malden
        ```Pay the territory protection for custom territory ID `fort_kickass` on server `esm_malden`
