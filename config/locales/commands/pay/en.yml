        Some servers may implement a tax for paying using ESM. You can see how much your territory's protection cost is by using `/territory list`
      example: |-
        **`/territory pay esm_malden qqoej`**
        Pay the territory protection for `qqoej` on server `esm_malden`

        **`/territory pay esm_malden fort_kickass`**
        Pay the territory protection for custom territory ID `fort_kickass` on server `esm_malden`
