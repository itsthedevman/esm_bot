          It looks like you found my help command! One of %{command_count_player} player commands that I respond to, %{command_count_total} in total.
          _Oh, where are my manners?_
          My name is **Exile Server Manager**, or ESM for short. I am a command bot that allows you to interact with any Arma 3 server that is registered with me!
