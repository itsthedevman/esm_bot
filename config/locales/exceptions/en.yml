      Hi there!
      Sorry for bothering you. I ran into an issue with sending a message to one of your channels. Since this is more than likely a permission issue, will you please ensure that I have permission to "View Channels" and text channel permission to "Send Messages" and "Embed Links"? Thanks!

      The channel I attempted to send to is "%{channel_name}" and I was told to send this:
      ```%{message}```
